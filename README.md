## Overview

kagi-css is a custom CSS file to beautify and liven up the Kagi search engine interface. With this stylesheet, you can enjoy a more visually appealing and dynamic search experience while using Kagi. Mainly inspired by Google and Brave Search, but with many exciting innovations of its own!

## Features

- **Glassmorphism**: A glass-inspired design for the settings and navigation bar
- **Documentation**: This css file has been documented quite accurately, which is why it is relatively easy to make changes
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and eye-catching effects
- **Enhanced UI Elements**: Improved buttons, search bar, and results layout
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Easy color changes**: There is a field at the beginning where you can easily change the most important colors as you wish
- **Uniform Design**: The design now extends to almost all pages, be it results, images, videos, news or podcasts.
